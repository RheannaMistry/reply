# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> I mostly learned how to use the library by throughly reading through the code. The library I did already had examples, which helped me make my own. One aspect of the module's code that made it easy to understand was that it was organized very well into the different methods. The README file was also very clear and explained the features of the library well. One change that would have made it easier would have been to put brackets in the conditional statements; some of them were missing, which made the code harder to read for me. 


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> To me, comments that raise the level of abstraction look more at the overall picture; they generalize instead of specify. By not getting too specific in the comments of particular code, it allows us to reuse the documentation later. I would tell the CSE 142 student to comment what the method does, and not how it does what it does.


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> It took me around 4-5 hours to complete this assignment.


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I went to office hours and got some help from Joel. I also asked Eden and Sophie a couple questions on Slack. 


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> I was receiving an error involving "octal literals." With Joel's help, I replaced the "\" character with "0o", wherever this problem was occuring.
